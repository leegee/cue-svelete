# `cue-svelte`

Personal project, work in progress: a first try at Svelte, setting and playing cue markers.

1. Enter a YoUTube URL
1. Optionally upload an SRT subtitle file
1. Play the video
1. Click a button at the start of a cue
1. Click it again at the end of a cue
1. Select cue type
1. Edidt cues
1. Export as SRT 

I had coded exporting the cues as a MIDI track, only to realise tempo changes make it unusable.

## To Do

1. Vimeo
1. Rumble
1. Display cues as for NewThinkingAllowed

## YT Test Video
