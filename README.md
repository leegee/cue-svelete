# `cue-svelte`

[This little app](https://leegee.github.io/cue-svelete/) is an aid to spotting cues for film scores.

The user supplies a video, and as it plays, can click to add cue markers.

These can then be exported as an SRT subittle file.

Currently playing with writing a MIDI and/or MusicXML file of markers and/or lyrics,
the problem is that Cubase seems extrememly fussy about what it will read.
